## Things to add

* sign in with facebook and Spotify - Facebook complete but errors with Spotifys Oauth according to ruby community
* users have the ability to add edit and destroy their own playlists - done
* search function
* forums/commenting sections - figuring out how i want to approach this.
* favoriting and possibly following other users playlists.

-
*Eventually i want to update the app for users to add each song individually through the site instead of just posting the playlists they pre-created on Spotify

*Maybe add youtube mixes? where it'll autoplay youtube videos
