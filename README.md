## Things to add before V.1.00

* sign in with facebook and Spotify - Facebook complete but errors with Spotifys Oauth according to ruby community
* need to add how to page for people who aren't sure how to find the embed link in spotify 
* users have the ability to add edit and destroy their own playlists - done
* search function
* forums/commenting sections - figuring out how i want to approach this.
* favoriting and possibly following other users playlists.
* Make buttons on header resemble cassette player buttons on stereo to add color flair.
* Playlist index needs to show the user only the playlists they posted.
* update pages controller to make the "get in touch" mailer to work
* Update information and About page to have actual information so i do not get sued by Spotify
* Make subscribe with email form to work through partial and save email information to subscriber model.
* eventually add pagination for mixtapes so the page doesn't turn into an infinite scroll

## V.1.1 addition ideas

* Eventually i want to update the app for users to add each song individually through the site instead of just posting the playlists they pre-created on Spotify

* Maybe add youtube mixes? where it'll autoplay youtube videos

* Mixtape of the day/week highlights

* Highlight users with popular mixtape additions

* Mixtape suggestions

* Mixtape tags for style of music then eventually links to specific styles of music.
